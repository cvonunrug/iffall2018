<p>When I pray</p>
<p>When I</p>
<p>When I pray</p>
<p>In the night, you come to me</p>
<p>'Cause I'm the one who knows who you are</p>
<p>Ooh</p>
<p>Give me your confession, saying</p>
<p>Lately, life's been tearing you apart</p>
<p>Now</p>
<p>Walk through the fire with you</p>
<p>'Cause I know how it can hurt</p>
<p>Being cut in two, and afraid</p>
<p><i>So don't break (break)</p>
<p>Sanctify my body with pain (pain)</p>
<p>Sanctify the love that you crave (crave)</p>
<p>Oh, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't be ashamed</p>
<p>Sanctify my sins when I pray</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh oh </p>
<p>When I pray</p></i>
<p>You don't have to be straight with me</p>
<p>I see what's underneath your mask</p>
<p>I'm a man like you, I breathe the rituals of the dancer's dance</p>
<p>Oh, oh</p>
<p>And there's fire in you</p>
<p>And you know it's gonna hurt, being cut in two</p>
<p>And afraid</p>
<p><i>So don't break (break)</p>
<p>Sanctify my body with pain (pain)</p>
<p>Sanctify the love that you crave (crave)</p>
<p>Oh, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't be ashamed</p>
<p>Sanctify my sins when I pray</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh oh </p>
<p>When I pray</p></i>
<p>Oh, oh, oh oh</p>
<p>You'll find redemption when all this is through</p>
<p>Father, forgive me for finding the truth</p>
<p>Love takes its toll on me, I'm just like you</p>
<p>Maybe it's heavenly</p>
<p>Maybe it's heavenly</p>
<p><i>So don't break (break)</p>
<p>Sanctify my body with pain (pain)</p>
<p>Sanctify the love that you crave (crave)</p>
<p>Oh, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't be ashamed</p>
<p>Sanctify my sins when I pray</p>
<p>Sanctify my body with pain (sanctify, sanctify my sins)</p>
<p>Sanctify the love that you crave (sanctify)</p>
<p>Oh, and I won't, and I won't, and I won't be ashamed (sanctify)</p>
<p>Sanctify my sins when I pray</p></i>
<p>Oh, oh, oh oh </p>
<p>When I pray</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh oh </p>
<p>When I pray</p>
