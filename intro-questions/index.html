	<ol>
		<li>My name is Carmen Maria von Unrug. I am majoring in Communication Design and Global health. I am a junior.</li>
		<li>I am from Lexington, Kentucky, and am trilingual. I was prompted to take this class due to my lack of experience, yet having these skills is useful.</li>
		<li>I have very little experience with HTML but last semester made a github and uploaded a document for typography.</li>
		<li>I hope to learn how to effectively make a website and develop many skills relating to coding and web design.</li>
		<li>I expect designing a screen to be different than designing paper due to the interface differences, yet also due to the more finicky nature of html.</li>
