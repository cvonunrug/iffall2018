			<h1>Osso Buco: Recipe Feedback Notes &mdash; Carmen Maria von Unrug</h1>

			<h2>Feedback- Person 1:</h2>

			<p>The top image could be 90% width; the title could also be smaller, just as long as it is consistent. The screen banner is nice but it should be darker to add contrast. The ingredients/amount needed is a bit staggered, so make them all left or right aligned to make them consistent/less staggered. Fix the flipped "Gremolata" and ingredients. Break up some of the steps if possible. Add paragraphs. As an extra tip: add servings, prep and cook time. Center looks good. Hyperlink citation (look up html hyperlink). Fix awkward space between image bottom and "Ingredients".
			</p>

			<h3>Feedback- Person 2:</h3>

			<p>The spacing is too tight along the sides; leading in Ingredients is too big; tighten this up. Fix the reversed stuff; Instructions is also too big/fix leading. Try to have step 1 align with ingredients if possible. Make footer centered/make it match everything else. Increase image size. Ingredients and Instructions are bigger than title- decrease the font size of these. Spacing is too big between the picture and the "Ingredients".</p>
